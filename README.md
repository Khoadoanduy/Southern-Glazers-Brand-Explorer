# SGWS Brand Explorer Project

![alt text](image.png)

**SGWS** is constantly looking for new ways to engage consumers with our supplier brands. The products we distribute are part of everyone’s celebrations in life. We want to make it easier for anyone to explore brands they love and make it fun to explore and learn new ways to enjoy with their friends and family.

This idea is to create a brand-specific (e.g., Crown Royal) cocktail creator that is very visual and feels like a game. An end user will select a specific product in a brand family (e.g., Crown Royal Blackberry) and then random words for flavors, themes, and occasions will be presented for them to choose from. Once selected, a set of cocktail recipes for them will appear, along with the instructions to make. The user can also rate the cocktails, share them with friends, and save them for later.

**SGWS** wants to create a solution that we can put on our website or mobile phone that will help individuals explore their favorite brands.

The **SGWS Brand Explorer** is an interactive solution that feels like a game, allowing users to learn more about their favorite brands and try out new ways to consume.

## Main Objectives

- Engage consumers with a supplier's brand (e.g., Crown Royal) and its products
- Increase awareness and trial of different flavors and cocktails
- Provide a fun and interactive experience that encourages creativity and socialization

## Project Goals

- Design a user-friendly and attractive interface that matches the brand identity
- Design a brand-agnostic framework so it can work with any brand (e.g., Bacardi, Grey Goose)
- Ensure the quality and accuracy of the cocktail suggestions meet responsible drinking standards
- Create a solution that works on a web app (mobile app optional)

## Use Case

My name is John. I love Crown Royal, and I heard about a new product called Crown Royal Blackberry. I go to [southernglazers.com/innovation](http://southernglazers.com/innovation) to learn about new products hitting the market. When I get to the Crown Royal page, I see a “How do you like your Crown Royal?” game. It's an interactive selection game where I select the different products of Crown Royal, flavors I like, and sweet, sour, stiff styles of drinks. It then presents me with a selection of recipes I can try.
